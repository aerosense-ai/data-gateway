<!-- PRs into main are released as soon as they are merged. Their descriptions will be used directly to create release notes, so make sure they contain everything! -->
<!-- Anything added between the auto-generation marker comments will be replaced on every pushed commit, so make sure to add anything you want to add outside of them. -->
<!-- However, any part of the final PR description (i.e. the description at the point of the final commit to the PR) can be changed and will be retained when producing the release notes -->
<!-- Please don't add features not discussed in an issue first -->
